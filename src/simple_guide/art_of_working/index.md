# How to Work Like a Scientist: A Simple Guide

## Starting Your Project

### First, Get Clear on What You're Doing
Ask yourself:
- What exact problem am I trying to solve?
- How will I know if I've solved it? (Be specific - like "90% accuracy" or "completes task in under 5 seconds")
- What are the boundaries of what I'm working on? (What's in scope and what isn't?)

### Do Your Homework
Before jumping in:
- Read at least 3-5 proper research papers (not just blog posts!)
- Look at what others in the industry are doing
- Write down what works and doesn't work in current solutions
- Keep notes on everything you read

### Make Your Best Guess
Write down:
- What you think will happen ("I think using three agents will work better than one because...")
- How you'll measure success
- What might go wrong
- What "good enough" looks like

## Setting Up Your Tests

### Plan Your Experiments
Think about:
- What exactly are you changing in each test?
- What are you keeping the same?
- How many times will you run each test?
- What numbers will you track?

### Keep Track of Everything
For each test, write down:
```
Test #: (give it a number)
What I'm testing: (be specific)
How I'm testing it: (step by step)
What I expect to happen:
What actually happened:
Numbers and results:
What I learned:
What to try next:
```

## When You're Building

### Development Steps
1. Start small - get something basic working first
2. Test thoroughly before adding complexity
3. Keep notes on what you try
4. Plan your next steps based on results

### Document As You Go
For each piece of code or system:
- What does it do?
- What does it need to work?
- What might make it break?
- How well does it perform?

## Looking at Results

### Analyzing What Happened
Keep track of:
- Raw numbers and data
- What the numbers mean
- How it compares to simpler solutions
- Unexpected things that happened
- Problems you found
- Ideas for improvements

## Sharing Your Work

### Progress Updates
When updating your manager or team:
```
Time period: [dates]
What got done:
- Tests run and what we learned
- Problems solved
- New problems found
What's next:
- Immediate next steps
- Bigger picture plans
- Help or resources needed
```

## The Right Way vs. The Wrong Way

### Do These Things:
- Write everything down
- Test your ideas properly
- Compare with simpler solutions
- Be honest about what doesn't work
- Keep your tests consistent
- Ask others to check your work
- Update your notes regularly

### Avoid These Mistakes:
- Making guesses without testing
- Skipping comparison with basic solutions
- Jumping to conclusions too quickly
- Hiding or ignoring failed attempts
- Changing multiple things at once
- Modifying tests partway through
- Presenting results without context

## Handling Common Situations

### When Things Don't Work as Expected
1. Write down what happened
2. Think about why it might have happened
3. Design new tests to figure it out
4. Be ready to change your original ideas
5. Tell your team what you found

### When You Hit Technical Problems
1. Write down the specific problems
2. Look for different approaches
3. Ask for help when needed
4. Think of workarounds
5. Be honest about what's possible

### When You Find New Problems
1. Write them down
2. Figure out if they affect your current work
3. Start a separate investigation if needed
4. Think about risks
5. Let everyone know what you found

### When Requirements Change
1. Think about how it affects your current tests
2. Write down what's changing
3. Update your testing plan
4. Change your success measures
5. Adjust your timeline
