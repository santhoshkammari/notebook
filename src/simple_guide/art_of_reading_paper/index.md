 Here's a practical way to read papers that will help you gain deeper knowledge:

First Pass (10-15 minutes):


Read the title carefully
Read the abstract fully - don't just skim
Look at all figures and tables - spend time understanding each one
Read the conclusions
Look at references - mark any you recognize or seem important


Second Pass (1 hour):


Introduction: What problem are they solving?
Method section carefully:

What exactly did they build/create?
How did they test it?
What metrics did they use?


Write down questions as they come up
Mark parts you don't understand
Draw diagrams if it helps


Deep Understanding (1-2 hours):


Focus on HOW they did things, not just WHAT they did
For each experiment:

Could you reproduce this?
What were the control variables?
Why did they choose these metrics?


Look for limitations they mention
Think about how this applies to your work

Specific Example for AI Agent Papers:
CopyPaper: "An Agent Architecture Paper"

Key Questions to Answer:
1. Architecture:
   - What components make up each agent?
   - How do agents communicate?
   - What's the control flow?

2. Capabilities:
   - What can each agent actually do?
   - What are the limitations?
   - How was this measured?

3. Implementation:
   - What specific models/techniques used?
   - Hardware requirements?
   - Training data needed?

4. Results:
   - How was success measured?
   - What were the failure cases?
   - Performance metrics?
